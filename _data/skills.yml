- skill: Agile Team and Project Management
  description: Good knowledge of agile project development processes like Scrum or Kanban. From my experience, there is no perfect predefined process that fits every organization, but this is something that should be incrementally build and improved - just like a software. I also have some experience with implementing workflows and functionalities in Jira, but I don't mind using any other project managment tool, as long as it works. I also have experience with leading sprints, organizing meetings and with organizing internal events like tech talks and hackdays.

- skill: User experience
  description: I never did this profesionally but while developing something on my own, I always involve a lot of thinking about UX and I always try to find good and meaningful solutions.

- skill: Creativity
  description: My mind is creative and it can be useful in proper environment where it feels warm and welcome. I can also suppress creative thinking when it is not needed or when it goes too far.
