  summary: GoAvio was meant to combine millions of low-cost flights, buses and trains in order to find the cheaper and faster routes. I was involved from the point where we had a clear idea about how we want to carry out our product and it was a great experience altogether. I took care of data integration (API/scraping), development of internal API, features for B2B customers and back office maintenance. Technologies involved are PHP (Laravel, Lumen), Angular2 (for back office application), Postgres (database was our UI), Redis, AWS, Docker, Vagrant, Grafana, InfluxDB etc. In the latest stage, part of the team was starting to build some microservices with Go lang, so I also got involved in Go learning.

  summary: Astina is a swiss web agency. I worked on 15+ projects, from large-scale (like babymueller.ch, fuji.ch, rheintaler.ch, zfv.ch, jelmoli.ch etc) to small-scale (like www.bullinger-ivpz.ch, www.valais.ch etc). Most of the applications were built with Symfony2 (PHP framework), but this is also where I started to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails (thanks to my coworker). We used some open source libraries and I also had the chance to contribute to some of those. Since we had dedicated front-end developers, I was also introduced to the modern (well, at least in that time) front-end technologies like Grunt, SASS, Compass, Bower etc. As a developers, we were closely involved in the development process (workflows, plannings etc) and I also had a chance to organize internal monthly tech talks. At first I started to work part-time (because of my studies), and then slowly moving to full-time.
