- skill: Agile Team and Project Management
  description: Good knowledge of agile project development processes like Scrum or Kanban. From my experience, there is no perfect predefined process that fits every organization, but this is something that should be incrementally developed and improved - just like a software. I have some experience with implementing workflows and functionalities in Jira, but I do not mind using any other project managment tool, as long as it covers all the needs. I also have experience with leading sprints, organizing meetings and with organizing internal events like tech talks and hackdays.

- skill: User experience
  description: I never had an opportunity to deal with UX professionaly but while developing something on my own, I involve a lot of thinking about UX and I always try to find good and meaningful solutions.

- skill: Creativity
  description: My mind is creative and it can be applicable in environment where it feels warm and welcome. I can also suppress creative thinking when it is not needed or when it goes too far.
