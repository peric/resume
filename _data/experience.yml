  position: Full Stack Developer
  duration: Dec 2012 &mdash; Aug 2015

  summary: I worked on 15+ projects, from large-scale (babymueller.ch, fuji.ch, rheintaler.ch, zfv.ch, jelmoli.ch etc.) to small-scale (www.bullinger-ivpz.ch, www.valais.ch etc.). Most of the applications were built with Symfony2 (PHP framework), but I also started to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails here. We used open source libraries and I had the chance to contribute to some of those. Since we had dedicated front-end developers, I was also introduced to the modern (well, at least at that time) front-end technologies such as Grunt, SASS, Compass, Bower etc. As developers, we were closely involved in the development process (workflows, planning etc.) and I also had a chance to organize internal monthly tech talks.
