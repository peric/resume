  summary: GoAvio was meant to combine millions of low-cost flights, buses and trains in order to find the cheapest and fastest way to destination. I was there from the point where we had clear idea about how we want to carry out our product and it was a great journey. I was taking care about data integration (API/scraping), development of API endpoints, features for B2B customers and back office maintenance. Technologies involved are PHP (Laravel, Lumen), Angular2 (for back office application), Postgres (database was our UI), Redis, AWS, Docker, Vagrant, Grafana, InfluxDB etc. In the latest stage, part of the team was starting to build some microservices with Go lang, so I also got involved into Go learning.

  summary: Astina is a swiss-based web agency. I have been working on 15+ projects, from large-scale (like babymueller.ch, fuji.ch, rheintaler.ch, zfv.ch, jelmoli.ch etc) to small-scale (like www.bullinger-ivpz.ch, www.valais.ch etc). Most of the application were built with Symfony2 (PHP framework), but this is also where I have started to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails (thanks to my coworker). We were using quite some open source libraries and I have also had chance to contribute into some of those. Since we had dedicated front end developers, I was also introduced to the modern (well, at least in that time) frontend technologies like Grunt, SASS, Compass, Bower etc. As a developers, we were closely involved in development process (workflows, plannings etc) and I also had a chance to organize internal monthly tech talks. At first I started to work part-time (because of my studies), and then slowly moving to full-time.

My main job was to test and report frontend issues with frontend functionalities, but also being involved in the customer support, improvement and optimization of testing process etc. For a short period I was also working on the in-house project built with Django framework that we used to plan and execute Scrum sprints - soon after that we have discovered and started to use Trello. For some time, I have also been writing and using Python parsers to collect the data from various websites and I have also worked on few other experiments during the internal Hackdays. I have worked part-time since I have needed a lot of time for my studies.
