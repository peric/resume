  description: MySQL, Firebird, XML, JSON, CSV or YAML open source generator for custom Countries data. Project was born on a lazy Sunday afternoon - well, at least the first jQuery version of it.

Same evening, I have wrote an article and published it on HackerNews - since then, project has received 320+ stars on GitHub and quite some contributers. In 2015, I did a complete rewrite by using React, which replaced most of ugly jQuery code.
